# Distributed web infrustructure
web applications are complex, heterogeneous, distributed systems that are highly dynamic with unpredictable control flows. Specific requirements characterize them, such as huge time-to-market pressure, distributed infrastructure, high asynchronicity, and constant shifts in user requirements.
## Load balancer configuration
Load balancing is an excellent way to scale out your application and increase its performance and redundancy. Nginx, a popular web server software, can be configured as a simple yet powerful load balancer to improve your serverâ€™s resource availability and efficiency.

## Data synchronization
Data synchronization ensures accurate, secure, compliant data and successful team and customer experiences. It assures congruence between each source of data and its different endpoints. As data comes in, it is cleaned, checked for errors, duplication, and consistency before being put to use
## Master database
The master database records all the system-level information for a SQL Server system. This includes instance-wide metadata such as logon accounts, endpoints, linked servers, and system configuration settings. In SQL Server, system objects are no longer stored in the master database; instead, they are stored in the Resource database. Also, master is the database that records the existence of all other databases and the location of those database files and records the initialization information for SQL Server. Therefore, SQL Server cannot start if the master database is unavailable.
